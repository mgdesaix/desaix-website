In this study, I focus on the use of ecological genomics to forecast climate change impacts. Climate change is affecting biodiversity by causing changes in habitat suitability and disrupting genetic-environment associations underlying local adaptation. While these processes are commonly studied independently, here we provide an integrated analysis of whole-genome sequence and ecological data to study how climate change may affect where populations can persist, and the magnitude of genetic change required to adapt to changing conditions. We use the Brown-capped Rosy-Finch (*Leucosticte australis*), an alpine obligate species, as an ideal model organism for this study because of the rapid climate change that is occurring in alpine environments. This study aims to 1) forecast changes in the adaptive landscape due to climate change for this alpine species, by characterizing how much genetic change is required (genomic offset) and where populations can persist to minimize genomic offset; 2) predict climate-driven habitat suitability shifts into the future, and 3) compare the underlying climatic drivers of, and spatial vulnerability to, genomic offset and habitat suitability.

Details coming soon.
