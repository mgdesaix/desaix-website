intro: I've been working to advance the field of using genomics to forecast climate vulnerability in populations. I'm also continuing to use migratory birds as a model to address questions of conservation with genomic tools. Through this work I also get to collaborate with numerous researchers, travel (Trinidad & Tobago!), have fun developing resources in R (bookdown projects, packages), and write bioinformatics pipelines. I'm also currently enhancing my skills in the backcountry of Colorado through [avalanche hazard management training](https://avtraining.org/aiare-level-1/), ski mountaineering and alpine climbing.
