<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a PhD candidate in Biology at the [Ruegg Lab](https://sites.google.com/rams.colostate.edu/ruegglab/home) at Colorado State University and I also work with the [Bird Genoscape Project](https://www.birdgenoscape.org/). My work as a biologist began in 2014 backpacking the sky islands of New Mexico looking for Mexican Spotted Owls with the [Bird Conservancy of the Rockies](https://www.birdconservancy.org/), and then to the Peruvian Amazon to monitor birds across an elevational gradient for the [Manu Project](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~jankowsk/Manu_Project.html).
