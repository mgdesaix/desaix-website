<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a PhD candidate in Biology at the [Ruegg Lab](https://sites.google.com/rams.colostate.edu/ruegglab/home) at Colorado State University and I also work with the [Bird Genoscape Project](https://www.birdgenoscape.org/). My work as a biologist began in 2014 backpacking the sky islands of New Mexico looking for Mexican Spotted Owls with the [Bird Conservancy of the Rockies](https://www.birdconservancy.org/), and then to the Peruvian Amazon to monitor birds across an elevational gradient for the [Manu Project](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~jankowsk/Manu_Project.html). After several years of field work, I went to Virginia Commonwealth University to pursue a Masters degree using population genetics to study avian migration. Through that work, I developed a passion for getting into the weeds of statistics and bioinformatics to address complex evolutionary and ecological challenges. After my Masters, I spent a year in the wonderful New River Gorge region of West Virginia teaching and whitewater kayaking. In 2019, I moved to Fort Collins, CO - a perfect place to be a scientist and alpinist.
